  abstract = {Screening for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in especially environmental samples with (meta)genomic sequencing is associated with false-positive predictions of phenotypic resistance. This stems from the fact that most acquired ARGs require being overexpressed before conferring resistance, which is often caused by decontextualization of putative ARGs by mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Consequent overexpression of ARGs can be caused by strong promoters often present in insertion sequence (IS) elements and integrons and the copy number effect of plasmids, which may contribute to high expression of accessory genes.Here, we screen all complete bacterial RefSeq genomes for ARGs. The genetic contexts of detected ARGs are investigated for IS elements, integrons, plasmids, and phylogenetic dispersion. The ARG-MOB scale is proposed, which indicates how mobilized detected ARGs are in bacterial genomes. It is concluded that antibiotic efflux genes are rarely mobilized and even 80\% of {$\beta$}-lactamases have never, or very rarely, been mobilized in the 15,790 studied genomes. However, some ARGs are indeed mobilized and co-occur with IS elements, plasmids, and integrons.In this study, ARGs in all complete bacterial genomes are classified by their association with MGEs, using the proposed ARG-MOB scale. These results have consequences for the design and interpretation of studies screening for resistance determinants, as mobilized ARGs pose a more concrete risk to human health. An interactive table of all results is provided for future studies targeting highly mobilized ARGs.}

  abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing challenge for public health. In 2019 alone, 1.27 million people have died of causes directly linked to infections caused by resistant bacteria. This problem does not only focus on the clinical health of humans, but also causes issues in other aspects of public health of humans and animals. Resistant bacteria, but also genes conferring AMR, can be transferred to humans via direct animal contact, the food chain or the environment. AMR genes can arise through mutations, but can also be transferred between cells through means of horizontal gene transfer by mobile genetic elements (MGEs). An important factor in the dissemination of AMR genes is dissemination by plasmids. These extrachromosomal DNA molecules can between bacterial cells, not necessarily following species barriers. This capability makes that plasmids are an important contributing factor to the spread of AMR genes. Therefore, to investigate the spread of AMR genes, it is essential to investigate the spread of plasmids. Two techniques to investigate the DNA of plasmids are whole genome sequencing (WGS) and metagenomics. In WGS, the genome of a cultured bacterial colony is read, whereas in metagenomics, a large part of the genetic material in environmental samples is sequenced, without prior filtering or culturing of bacteria. This makes the resulting data much more complex and generates much more raw data compared to WGS experiments. In Chapter 2 and 3, I focus on plasmids in WGS data. I describe a collection of software tools: plasmidEC, plasmidCC, and gplas2 versions Bilbao and Flevo. PlasmidEC and plasmidCC are capable of identifying sequences originating from plasmids, based on six species-specific plasmid databases and one species-agnostic plasmid database. Gplas2 is an extension of the gplas algorithm that uses the assembly graph to reconstruct plasmid fragments into plasmid `bins' that are likely to originate from the same plasmid. In Chapter 4 and 5, I focus on metagenomics data to assess the spread of mobile AMR genes. In Chapter 4, I present a software pipeline called MetaMobilePicker, that uses existing tools to assemble metagenomic reads, identify MGEs and annotate AMR genes. By validating this pipeline using simulated metagenomics data with known MGEs, I show that the metagenomics assembly step, is the bottleneck for the identification of MGEs like plasmids. I show that not all reads originating from MGEs are assembled correctly, or are assembled without enough context to be correctly identified as an MGE. In Chapter 5, I focus on the composition of the microbiome, the collection of AMR genes (the resistome), and the collection of MGEs (the mobilome) in the caecum and the faeces of broiler chickens, and compare these between two interventions to prevent coccidiosis. I show that there are measurable differences in the microbiome and resistome between these intervention methods. Additionally, I identify AMR genes located on plasmids that are present in both the caecum as well as the faeces on the farmhouse floor, which makes them interesting starting points for further research into the way mobile AMR genes can spread between environments.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Acinetobacter baumannii               is a Gram-negative pathogen responsible for hospital-acquired infections with high levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The spread of multidrug-resistant               A. baumannii               strains has become a global concern. Spread of AMR in               A. baumannii               is primarily mediated by the acquisition of AMR genes through mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the role of different plasmid types in disseminating AMR genes is essential. Here, we analysed the distribution of plasmid types, sampling sources, geographic locations, and AMR genes carried on               A. baumannii               plasmids. A collection of 813 complete plasmid entries was collated and analysed. We previously devised an               Acinetobacter               Plasmid Typing (APT) scheme where               rep               types were defined using 95\% nucleotide identity and updated the scheme in this study by adding 12 new               rep               /Rep types (90 types in total). The APT scheme now includes 178 unique Rep variants belonging to three families: R1, R3, and RP. R1-type plasmids were mainly associated with global clone 1 strains, while R3-type plasmids were highly diverse and carried a variety of AMR determinants including carbapenem, aminoglycoside and colistin resistance genes. Similarly, RP-type and               rep               -less plasmids were identified as important carriers of aminoglycoside and carbapenem resistance genes. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the distribution and characteristics of               A. baumannii               plasmids, shedding light on their role in the dissemination of AMR genes. The updated APT scheme and findings enhance our understanding of the molecular epidemiology of               A. baumannii               and provide valuable insights for surveillance and control strategies.},

  abstract = {Plasmids are the primary vector for horizontal transfer of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within bacterial populations. We applied the MOB-suite, a toolset for reconstructing and typing plasmids, to 150{$\mkern1mu$}767 publicly available                                                   Salmonella                                               whole-genome sequencing samples covering 1204 distinct serovars to produce a large-scale population survey of plasmids based on the MOB-suite plasmid nomenclature. Reconstruction yielded 183{$\mkern1mu$}017 plasmids representing 1044 primary MOB-clusters and 830 potentially novel MOB-clusters. Replicon and relaxase typing were able to type 83.4 and 58{$\mkern1mu\%$} of plasmids, respectively, compared to 99.9{$\mkern1mu\%$} for MOB-clusters. Within this work, we developed an approach to characterize the horizonal transfer of MOB-clusters and AMR genes across different serotypes, as well as the diversity of MOB-cluster associations with AMR genes. Aggregating conjugative mobility predictions provided by the MOB-suite and their corresponding serovar entropy demonstrated that non-mobilizable plasmids were associated with fewer serotypes compared to mobilizable or conjugative MOB-clusters. The host-range predictions for MOB-clusters also showed differences between the mobility classes, with mobilizable MOB-clusters accounting for 88.3{$\mkern1mu\%$} of the multi-phyla (broad-host-range) predictions compared to 3 and 8.6{$\mkern1mu\%$} for conjugative and non-mobilizable, respectively. A total of 296 (22{$\mkern1mu\%$}) of identified MOB-clusters were associated with at least one resistance gene, indicating that the majority of                                                   Salmonella                                               plasmids are not involved in AMR dissemination. Shannon entropy analysis of horizontal transfer of AMR genes across serovars and MOB-clusters demonstrated that horizonal transfer of genes is higher between serovars compared to transfer between different MOB-clusters. In addition to the population structure characterization based on primary MOB-clusters, we characterized a multi-plasmid outbreak responsible for the global dissemination of               bla               CMY-2               across different serotypes using higher resolution MOB-suite secondary cluster codes. The plasmid characterization approach developed here can be applied to different organisms to identify plasmids and genes which pose high risks for horizontal transfer.},

In comparison to self-transmissible conjugative plasmids, mobilizable plasmids have received much less attention due to their defects in conjugative elements. However, the contribution of mobilizable plasmids to the horizontal transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence genes of                 K. pneumoniae                 remains unclear. In this study, the transfer, stability, and cargo genes of the mobilizable plasmids of                 K. pneumoniae                 were examined via genetic experiments and genomic analysis                 .                                                        Methods                                Carbapenem-resistant (CR) plasmid pHSKP2 and multidrug-resistant (MDR) plasmid pHSKP3 of                 K. pneumoniae                 HS11286, virulence plasmid pRJF293 of                 K. pneumoniae                 RJF293 were employed in conjugation assays to assess the transfer ability of mobilizable plasmids. Mimic mobilizable plasmids and genetically modified plasmids were constructed to confirm the cotransfer models. The plasmid morphology was evaluated through                 Xba                 I and S1 nuclease pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and/or complete genome sequencing. Mobilizable plasmid stability in transconjugants was analyzed via serial passage culture. In addition, in silico genome analysis of 3923 plasmids of 1194 completely sequenced                 K. pneumoniae                 was performed to investigate the distribution of the conjugative elements, the cargo genes, and the targets of the CRISPR-Cas system. The mobilizable MDR plasmid and virulence plasmid of                 K. pneumoniae                 were investigated, which carry                 oriT                 but lack other conjugative elements.                                                        Results                                Our results showed that mobilizable MDR and virulence plasmids carrying                 oriT                 but lacking the relaxase gene were able to cotransfer with a helper conjugative CR plasmid across various                 Klebsiella                 and                 Escherichia coli                 strains. The transfer and stability of mobilizable plasmids rather than conjugative plasmids were not interfered with by the CRISPR--Cas system of recipient strains. According to the in silico analysis, the mobilizable plasmids carry about twenty percent of acquired antimicrobial resistance genes and more than seventy-five percent of virulence genes in                 K. pneumoniae.                                                        Conclusions                                Our work observed that a mobilizable MDR or virulence plasmid that carries                 oriT                 but lacks the relaxase genes transferred with the helper CR conjugative plasmid and mobilizable plasmids escaped from CRISPR--Cas defence and remained stable in recipients. These results highlight the threats of mobilizable plasmids as vital vehicles in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes in                 K. pneumoniae                 .},
